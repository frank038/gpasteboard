(Python) Gtk3 GNU/Linux Clipboard.


Gpasteboard is a clipboard program for Linux.
The main program and its applet are built using
Python (version 3) and the Gtk3 libraries. 
The history is managed using the internal xml module. 
No additional modules are required.

Gpasteboard can store and set pieces of text and
can store, set and save pictures. It can show the 
preview of the stored items, can delete each entry
or the whole history.

As default option, the path names of the copied files and folders are stored no more.
This behaviour can be changed at the beginning of the file.
