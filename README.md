(Python) Gtk3 Clipboard.

Free to use and modify.

Gpasteboard is a clipboard program for Linux.
The main program and its applet are built using
Python3 and the Gtk3 libraries. 
No additional modules are required.

Gpasteboard can store and set pieces of text and
can store, set and save pictures (or disable this option in the config file). It can show the 
preview of the stored items, can delete each entry
or the whole history.

As default option, the path names of the copied files and folders are not stored.
This behaviour, and other settings, can be changed in the config file.

To execute this program from the terminal:
./gpasteboard.sh
or
python3 Gpasteboard.py
